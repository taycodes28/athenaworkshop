My project is an about me page. I split it into two pages, a home page and a portfolio page. I started the project during the Girls Who Code pathways program. I do not have much expierience coding webpages and this page helped me practice using css and html. I made it because I wanted to create a page that represented me. I struggled most with styling it because it was my first time working with css. In my mind I had all of these ideas I wanted to do, but I was confused on how to do them. For example, I wanted my pictures to be lined up, but I only knew how to do this by adding a table. I learned from this that it is okay to go on google to ask for answers instead of stressing myself out. In the end I made it work, and I feel that my page shows a lot about me.
